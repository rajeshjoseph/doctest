= Stopping and Restarting {{ book.productTitle }} Instance

When you stop and restart a {{ book.productTitle }} instance, Amazon Web
Services assigns the instance a new IP address and hostname. This
results in the instance losing its association with the virtual
hardware, causing disruptions to the trusted storage pool. To prevent
errors, add the restarted {{ book.productTitle }} instance to the
trusted storage pool. See
<<../architecture/chap-Trusted_Storage_Pools.adoc#Adding_Servers_to_the_Trusted_Storage_Pool,
Adding Servers to the Trusted Storage Pool>>.

Rebooting the {{ book.productTitle }} instance preserves the IP address
and hostname and does not lose its association with the virtual
hardware. This does not cause any disruptions to the trusted storage
pool.
